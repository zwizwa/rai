# This uses the uc_tools build script (uc_tools/linux/build.sh)

# The build rules are generated from the erl_tools redo tool
# dependency graph.  See also erl_ducktape/src/rai.erl for glue
# between Erlang code and RAI.

# Note that uc_tools build system does not support a separate build
# tree.  This was done intentionally as part of uc_tools design to
# simplify building multiple architectures, but does require symlink
# or copy into this build tree.  Typically uc_tools is only used for
# *.h and mod_*.c files and no *.o files need to be produced in the
# uc_tools tree, in which case the link can point to a read-only
# directory such as the nix store.
