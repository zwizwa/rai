- ai-array.rkt:

  - cast/n just decouples type inference.  needs base type
    unification.  not a problem in many cases because there is enough
    information to "fill" the unification graph.


- type.rkt:

  - add base type unification

- (values x x) for processor gives "error: duplicate member"
